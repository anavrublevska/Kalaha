        <p class="pa">At the beginning of the game, four seeds are placed in each house. Ends are empty.</p>
        <p class="pa">The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent.</p>

            <p class="pa">Players take turns sowing their seeds. On a turn, the player removes all seeds from one of the houses under their control. </p>
            <p class="pa">Moving counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed in each house in turn, including the player's own store but not their opponent's.</p>
            <p class="pa">If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, and the opposite house contains seeds, both the last seed and the opposite seeds are captured and placed into the player's store.</p>
            <p class="pa">If the last sown seed lands in the player's store, the player gets an additional move. There is no limit on the number of moves a player can make in their turn.</p>
